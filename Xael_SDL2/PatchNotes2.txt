Created some chests to loot. WOOT
Made a small section to show you what you gain each time you kill an enemy and or break open a Cask...
Made a new item in the shop that allows you to purchase weapon upgrades!!! - in doing so, decreased the starting dmg by 25%.
created a windows window that renders graphics. have a few in place and now rendering correctly..
added a new enemy, Rats. 
added an animation for the townsfolk. just as placeholders. 
After killing the boss, you can now continue the game just killing and upgrading.
more graphics and animations will come over time, but I need to focus more on functionality and more content.
