All requests are welcome! Not all requests are fulfilled. However, before you make a request, please read patch notes so you don't ask me to fix something I have already done. Thank you!


Added a door to the catacombs, now you MUST speak to the mayer before you can go down. Also, with this the enemies can not roam the town, YEAH!

Fixed bug where if you don't enter a name you get no dialog. You will now be named Kubas by default if you don't choose one yourself.

Fixed bug where if you had more health than what your maximum is supposed to be due to heals from endurance kill, and you use a potion, it will no longer let you. no more wasted potions. Same for the endurance potions.

Fixed issue when shopping that you would have to enter the shop for each purchase. Added a shopping loop similer to the pause menu when using potions.

Added a way to SAVE and RELOAD from save!!! (WOOOO, big deal here, I might be able to make the game longer and harder. Mini Bosses, more levels, more Towns. different items..ect)
