I would like to thank you for taking a look at my project. I am very proud of this project though it is not complete yet and I have recently made the updates that are in the PatchNotes.txt. I would like to mention a few things about the project. I started this game while I was attending Academy of Art University, this was my final project for the class. My game was fun enough for my instructor to play it a few times over. I plan on adding more and more to this game and eventually graphics. 

I also intend on reorganizing a lot of my code as well now that I have more experience and noticing trends in my code that could just use another function or Class. I am not sure what information I should add here though. So for now, I will let you play the game, look at the code, or do whatever it is that you do when you look at potential canidates. Thank you for your time and consideration.
